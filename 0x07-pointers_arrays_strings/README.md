# welcome to more advanced arrays and pointers

## task 0

Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

- Prototype: char ```*memset(char*s, char b, unsigned int n);```
- The ```_memset()``` function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
- Returns a pointer to the memory area s
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: ```memset```. Run ```man memset``` to learn more.
