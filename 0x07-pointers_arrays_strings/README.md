# welcome to more advanced arrays and pointers

## task 0

Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

1- Prototype: char ```*memset(char*s, char b, unsigned int n);```
2-  The ```_memset()``` function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
3- Returns a pointer to the memory area s.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: ```memset```. Run ```man memset``` to learn more.

## task 1

Write a function that copies memory area.

1- Prototype: ```char *_memcpy(char*dest, char *src, unsigned int n);```
2- The ```_memcpy()``` function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
3- Returns a pointer to dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memcpy. Run man memcpy to learn more.
